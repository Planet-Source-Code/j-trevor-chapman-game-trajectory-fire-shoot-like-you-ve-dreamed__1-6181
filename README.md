</div>

### Description

Have you ever wanted to create a game where the character or tank or whatever can shoot something, and instead of just drawing a straight line it took into acount gravity(or none) angle(direction)power/speed(velocity) then calculated it and created a curve upon which the object of your choice, like a sprite or shape or button, or character.. ANYTHING, followed WITHOUT SHOWING THE CURVED LINE ITSELF? Like in the old favorite scorched earth. Those tanks would shoot a curved path. THIS DOES EXACTLY THAT. BUT ALL IN A MODULE! so you dont have to worry about anthing. every aspect of this code is DOCUMENTED. So that you understand every bit. At least 2 sentances per action!

Whether you need this for a game, or math program, or just fun! Or you want to learn more about the power of visual basic, Game Programming in VB or just are curios and WANT TO EXPAND YOUR KNOWLEDGE, this code is for you! Learn more about parametrice FUnctions! If you so desire.

Its all in a module, so you just have to give an angle, speed,and the amount of time or distance for the bomb or whatever to go! The potential of this is limitless! Time bombs! Bullets. Creatures jumping! Skydiving! Graphing!

So check this code out! And dont forget to vote! Its not worth putting code up here if you dont get voted for!
